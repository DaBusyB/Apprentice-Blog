# Apprentice-Blog

I am publishing a blog for two purposes:

1) To track my Apprenticeship Journey

It would be nice to be able to look back and see how far I've come, especially on days when I don't feel like I'm making enough progress.


2) Complete the required competencies of my Apprenticeship curriculum

Competencies are my way of implementing what I have learned and therefore proving that I have learned from the required modules.
Adding features per the request of my mentor and in the end, creating a fully functional application would help me complete the majority of my competencies.
